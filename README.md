# Quizzer

Quizzer is a very simple quiz app built with Svelte, that allows you to take quizzes with 5 questions. The questions come from an external API `https://opentdb.com/`.

There is also a very very complex (/s) login system built in, that allows you to login using an email and a password.

This project was very very fun to make, I'm really glad I learned about Svelte tbh, it makes building little apps very fun and I'm actually excited to use it in the future. ðŸ¥³
